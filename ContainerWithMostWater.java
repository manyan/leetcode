/*
 * Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, â€¦, an, where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Note: You may not slant the container.
 * */

/*
 *  solution: actually its the similar the one that find the max rectangle of a array
 *  the different is: in this question, we can just find 2 stickers, left sticker and right sticker, then make a container, so we can ignore the stickers
 *  between left sticker and right sticker, but max rectangle need to calculate the stickers between left and right
 *  in find the max rectangle of a array, we use a Monotone increasing queue to hold the current max
 *  but in this implementation, i am going to use another method to solve it in o(n) time without extra space
